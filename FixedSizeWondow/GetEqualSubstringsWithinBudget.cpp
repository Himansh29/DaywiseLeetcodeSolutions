1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget
Medium 1551 112

Q) -> You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

    You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

    Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

public:
    int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        
    }
};
int main()
{
    

    return 0;
